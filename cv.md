### About Myself:

Currently, I work as a leading technical support engineer.
I am a student of the Faculty of Applied Computer Science, specializing in digital business transformation.

Previously, I took an HTML layout course at htmlacademy and realized what I wanted to do next. 
I love seeing the results of my work and being able to show them to family and friends.

Working in the front-end direction will give me the opportunity to do exactly what I want. 
Connect with like-minded people and gain new experiences every day.

I try to learn every day, gain new knowledge, and understand that today I am better than yesterday.
